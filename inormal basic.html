            <p>Informal training, also known as informal learning or informal development, occurs outside of structured educational or training programs.
                 It is a flexible, learner-driven approach where individuals acquire knowledge, skills, and competencies through everyday experiences and interactions.
                  Here are the basics of informal training:</p>
                <h3>Characteristics of Informal Training</h3>
                <p>1.Unstructured: Informal training does not follow a predefined curriculum or schedule.<br>
                2.Spontaneous: Learning occurs naturally as individuals engage in various activities.<br>

                5.Experiential: Emphasis on learning through doing and reflecting on experiences.</p>
