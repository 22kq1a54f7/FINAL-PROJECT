<br><br>
Evaluation and Assessment: Formal training often includes assessments, tests, or evaluations to measure the learners' progress and understanding of the material. These assessments may be conducted through quizzes, exams, practical demonstrations, or projects.
<br><br>
Certification or Credentialing: Successful completion of formal training programs may lead to the attainment of a certification, diploma, degree, or other credentials, depending on the nature and level of the training.
<br><br>
Defined Learning Objectives: Formal training programs typically have clear learning objectives that outline what participants should know, understand, or be able to do by the end of the training.
<br><br>
Scheduled Sessions: Formal training programs are usually scheduled at specific times and locations, either in-person or virtually, to accommodate participants' availability and ensure consistency in delivery.
<br><br>
Costs and Investments: Participation in formal training often requires some form of investment, whether it's through tuition fees, registration costs, or time commitments. However, many employers may provide financial support or sponsor employees for formal training opportunities.
